<p><em>As I remember it:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He walked over the sand, knelt and grabbed a fistful of it.
Then, he let it fall between his fingers, and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed the desert.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like him, I&rsquo;m here in front of the vast Internet, unable to see more than glimpses of it.</p>
<p>May the post in this blog be my grains of sand.</p>
